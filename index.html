### Say Something
- keep calm

### Choices

You can:
- copy the _index.html_ file to _tech-deck.html_
   - modify it
   - put as many 'decks' as you like in this repo
   - and then open tech-deck.html in your browser
- or keep cloning/forking to multiple repositories..

---
I like to
``` bash
code README.md
```

to get nice coloring and edit help/cues from my editor, VSCode.
